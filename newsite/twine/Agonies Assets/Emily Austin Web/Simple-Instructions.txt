3IP Webfonts Simple Instruction Sheet

If you don’t know how to host your own webfont, follow these instructions:

1. Unzip the webfont archive you’ve downloaded upon ordering.

2. Upload the enclosed folder (named for the font you licensed) to your website directory in the same place as your stylesheet(s) (your .css file or files, if any), keeping a copy locally for backup.

3. Open an HTML file for a test page on which you wish your webfont to appear, and check for a stylesheet link, e.g.:

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mystylesheet.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8" />

4. Download and open the referenced .css file.

5. Open the [Fontname].css file from your local webfont backup and copy the entire @font-face declaration, paste it into your website’s .css file, then apply the @font-family property to an element or class, e.g., one of these methods:

   p { font-family: [Fontname], Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }

   .3ipfontclass { font-family: [Fontname], Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;}

6. Make sure to apply this element or class to the HTML file for your test page where you want the font to appear.

7. Upload both your test HTML file and revised .css file to your website directory.

8. View your test page in various browsers.
