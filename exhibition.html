                                  <p class="text-secondary"></br>This exhibition is the result of two years of research of 19th-century Victorian
                                    newspapers. For much of the 19th century, these newspapers featured a column on the first page known as
                                    the Personals. These were contributions written by individuals rather than journalists or editors, and
                                    often included complaints of lost loves, missing pets, and other miseries. As a result, they became known
                                    as the Agony Columns. </br></br>
                                    But the Agony Columns were also much, much more. Throughout 19th-century England,
                                    people often used the Personals as a way to communicate with one another, often in
                                    code or cipher, indented for particular recipients. This form of cryptic communication not only
                                    allowed for many to participate in love affairs discouraged by family members, but also to partake
                                    in criminal activities, plan escapes, elope, and communicate privately over long distances.</br></br>
                                    They became a source of infinite fascination. For some, they provided breakfast
                                    conversation and dinner-time gossip. For others, they became a source of entertainment, allowing
                                    readers to engage in code breaking and puzzles over fifty years before the first crossword puzzle.
                                    Private investigators not unlike Sherlock Holmes would read, post, and follow up on notices from
                                    the Agony Columns, whereas potential grooms and brides would scoure the newspapers for potential
                                    spouses. Later, they became prime material for fiction, contributing to the development of genres
                                    such as the Newspaper Novels, Sensation Fiction, and Detective stories.
                                    The Agony Columns were the first available medium for personal mass communication in England,
                                    and, like today, were both a source of anxiety and delight to those who participated in them.</br></br>
                                    This exhibition contains two stories.
                                    One follows the development of the Agony Columns in the Times, the most popular newspaper of
                                    the era, and recounts the many tales, ciphers, and novels that the columns engendered. Though not
                                    many know of their existence, they are still a source of fascination , and this exhibition not only
                                    tries to understand why the Victorians found the Agony Columns captivating, but also how and why we
                                    discuss them today, from contemporary novels to movies, tv shows, and video games.The other story told
                                    in this exhibition is a narrative experience. It attempts to question the fascination of Agony Columns
                                    by offering a non-linear story, allowing users to experience the lure of the Personals for themselves.</br></br>
                                    This exhibition is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada. We hope you enjoy it.</p>
