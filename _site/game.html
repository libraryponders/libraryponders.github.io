            <p><b>The scene is mid-19th century London.</b> The growing metropolis, center of the British Empire, is bustling with trade and commerce. Novels are all the rage and newsvendors line the streets peddling the day’s headlines. In a city of three million, however, not all news is good news. Within the Agony Column of <em>The Times</em>, as it came to be known, lurks the mysteries and sordid dealing of London’s inhabitants in all their illicit intrigue.</p>
            <p>In this short, narrative game, you play as a detective for the Metropolitan Police helping to solve the disappearance of a missing girl. Eliza has all but vanished, leaving behind only a trail of clues in <em>The Times</em> and a mother worried sick for the safety of her child. Luckily for her, Ignatius Pollaky – the so-called “real life Sherlock Holmes” – is on the case. Still, time of the essence. Try your hand at solving the case and see if you have what to takes to crack The Ciphers of <em>The Times</em>.</p>
