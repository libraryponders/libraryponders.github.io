EMILY AUSTIN™

Thank you for licensing Emily Austin™, a member of the 3IP Type Library. We appreciate your business very much.

Emily Austin is modeled after the handwriting of Emily Margaret Austin (Bryan) Perry, an early Texas colonist along with her brother, Stephen F. Austin, for whom the state capital was named. Specimens were letters dating from 1837 until 1851, the year of her death at 56. Emily’s Texas descendants still celebrate her birthday each June. Emily Austin is one of several 3IP typefaces inspired by the penmanship of famous Texans — but the only one based on a woman’s hand. This intricate face, while true of the period, is nevertheless impressively legible, with a slight x-height and stylish uppercase characters. Use to recreate historical records, in vintage packaging, or to lend a personal touch to designs that evoke times gone by.

The OpenType release of Emily Austin comes with standard and discretionary ligatures, true fractions, lining and tabular figures, ink blots, cross-outs, and full Latin support.
