      <h2>About Ciphers of <em>The Times</em></h2>
      <p><b>Ciphers of <em>The Times</em></b> is a SSHRC-funded research project that investigates the Agony Columns of Victorian newspapers and its influence on Victorian society and literature. Using an interdisciplinary methodology of computational analysis and close reading we seek to interrogate and expand existing understandings of how the newspaper featured in Victorian novels.</p><p>The team is led by Nathalie Cooke. This site is part of a joint physical-virtual exhibition, curated in conjunction with the McGill Library. </p>

        <h3>Newspaper Novels</h3>
          <p>What is a newspaper novel? It is by no means a settled genre. Neither exclusively novels about newspaper culture nor stories published serially in periodicals, the newspaper novel is a hybrid form that sits at the intersection of 19th-century popular media.  Jessica Valdez, a scholar of Victorian literature, has put the question of a definition as such, challenging us to "consider novelistic representations of the newspaper and news discourse as sites of experimentation, where novelists tested out and imagined different scenarios for how print media might enter real life.”</p>
        <h3>The Agony Column</h3>
          <p> “A whole romance contained in four little lines”, “seven words [that] gave a three volume novel in a nutshell” — such are the descriptions that 19th-century commentators gave to the collection of personal advertisements known as the 'Agony Column.' Found on the front page of daily Victorian newspapers, the column published individual, largely anonymous contributions sent in by writers from across the British Empire. Though the Agony Column took its name in the early 1850s from the numerous complaints and indiscretions voiced within, over the course of the latter 19th-century it evolved into a public forum for Victorian citizens to communicate with family and friends and, in some cases, engage in clandestine and cryptic correspondences.&nbsp;</p>
          <p> Noting the popularity of the column, editors, such as those as the widely read <em>Times</em>, placed the advertisements on the cover of the newspaper, second only to shipping information and marriage and death notices. Typically a few dozen words in length, the agony ads were read by lovers, criminals, students, and entertainment seekers alike.</p>
        <h3>The Data</h3>
          <p>Archival image files of <em>The Times</em> were sourced through <a href="https://www.gale.com/c/the-times-digital-archive"><em>The Times</em> Digital Archive</a>, a Gale-Cengage resource. Optical character recognition (OCR), a process of image-to-text conversion, was completed using <a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/">Transkribus</a> and with generous support from READ-COOP.  Data on the Victorian novels was sourced from Project Gutenberg, txtlab's <a href="https://txtlab.org/data-sets/">NOVEL450</a> data set, and the <a href="https://www.linguisticsathuddersfield.com/hum19uk-corpus">HUM19UK</a> novel corpus.</p>
