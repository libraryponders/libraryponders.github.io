                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">What are <i>The Times</i>?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">The Times was the most popular newspaper in Victorian England
                                  but also the <i>times</i> our exhibition explores. The years between 1860 and 1910 are often
                                  considered the “golden age” of newspapers in England, but most publications were eclipsed
                                  by the popularity of The Times, whose circulation rose from 5000 in 1815 to a staggering
                                  58,000 by 1855 (Winkworth 61). Today, it is possible to analyze these newspapers using
                                  computational tools thanks to databases making digitized versions of these papers accessible.</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">What were the “Agony Columns”?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">For much of the 19th century, Victorian newspapers featured a column on the
                                  first page known as the "Personal Advertisements," or simply "the personals." These were
                                  contributions written by individuals rather than journalists or editors, and often included
                                  complaint ads of all kinds, from lost loves to missing pets. The agonizing voice of the
                                  contributors was what eventually gave these personal columns the name of "the agonies" or
                                  "the agony columns."</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Why were some written cryptically?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">There are many answers to this question, and our exhibition
                                  attempts to provide some answers to shed light on the phenomenon. As newspapers grew in
                                  popularity, other cultural changes were also affecting Victorian society. Urbanization and
                                  industrialization contributed to a rising sense of anonymity in large cities, such as
                                  London, leading to what Benedict Anderson has called a "community in anonymity" (qtd. In
                                  Rubery 55). As a result, more people relied on the growing popularity of mass media,
                                  specifically the Agony Columns, as a form of communication, often with people they had no
                                  prior relationship. Such communication, however, was public, featured prominently on the
                                  front page of popular newspapers. In order to conduct private correspondences, contributors
                                  used codes and ciphers to avoid revealing their conversations to the Victorian public.</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Who wrote coded messages in the Agony Columns?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">It is impossible to document precisely all the contributors and
                                  readers of 19th century agony columns. Our exhibition, however, focuses on three primary
                                  groups: tales of crime, stories of love, and narratives for fun. Criminals occasionally used
                                  the agony columns to communicate and schedule rendezvous locations and times. Others used
                                  the personals to find and develop relationships, and The Times columns have documented more
                                  than one runaway wife or husband, only to find them eloped or with their lovers at a later
                                  date. For readers, however, the Agony Columns were a source of tremendous entertainment, and
                                  many would spend hours reading about the dramatic stories unfolding before their eyes. Some
                                  even attempted to decipher these messages with varying degrees of success. Although it is
                                  difficult to know for sure, the concurrent rise of the Sensation Novel alongside the
                                  popularity of the Agony Columns may have led contributors to use the agonies as an outlet
                                  for creative writing, blurring fact and fiction and providing entertainment for the
                                  Victorian public, not unlike the crossword of today.</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Who have been famous readers-interpreters of Agony Ads?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">Throughout the 19th century, many were intrigued by the Agony
                                  Columns, but some were more fascinated than the rest.<br><br>

                                  <b>E.J. Wilson (? –1879)</b><br>

                                  Claimed to have written over 400 personal column messages between 1851-1870, E.J. Wilson was
                                  probably the single most prolific Agony Column message writer of the Victorian era. Not much
                                  is known about his life, but from what records remain he appears to have been a well-read
                                  Customs official. Leaving London for Ennis, Country Clare, he taught languages at a local
                                  school and died in Liverpool in 1879 (Winkworth 62). Numbered among the pseudonyms that
                                  Wilson used and addressed are: "To the Equator", "Indigo Blue", "Alexis", "Rogue et Noire",
                                  "Battledore and Shuttlecock", and many others (Winkworth 63).<br><br>

                                  <b>Ignatius Pollaky (1828–1918)</b><br>

                                  Today, of course, the most famous Victorian detective is the fictional Sherlock Holmes.
                                  But in the 19th century, deductive minds also existed, and these people scoured the newspapers for
                                  evidence and correspondence. Ignatius Pollaky was one of these. Pollaky was not only known
                                  for advertising his own business in the Agony Columns, but also for inserting mysterious
                                  notes and messages in the newspaper relating to his cases. As it appeared in <i>The Times</i> on 31
                                  July 1868: "Monsignor – Many roads lead to Rome, but how to return? The was is crooked, even
                                  for – Pollaky."<br><br>

                                  <b>Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802–1875) and Lyon Playfair (1818–1898)</b><br>

                                  Both prominent and well-known men in Victorian England, these two friends shared the hobby
                                  of decrypting coded messages that they found in <i>The Times</i>. They managed to decrypt some
                                  especially short and difficult ciphers, occasionally sending the cracked codes back to the
                                  newspaper in plain English. Later, both would become known for the Playfair Cipher, invented for
                                  secret communications via the telegraph and used in World War I and World War II. Their
                                  code-breaking occasionally revealed that not all ciphers contained dire and important
                                  messages, but were occasionally posted simply for the challenge and effect on the
                                  newspaper's readership.One coded message that appeared several times in 1852 read: "Tig tjvhw it tig
                                  jfhiiwola og tig psgvw – F.D.N." The cracked cipher appeared on 3 March 1852 as a response
                                  from Playfair, addressed to F.D.N.: "<i>The Times</i> is the Jefferies of the Press".<br><br>

                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Any relation to Agony Aunts?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">Yes! But their relation is perhaps not as close as the two names
                                  suggest. Though newspapers became both affordable and extremely popular in the mid-19th century,
                                  the earliest periodical publications date back to the 17th century. And ever since the birth
                                  of the newspaper, interactive exchanges between readers and columnists were not only encouraged
                                  but actively sought after. These interactive columns ultimately gave birth to today's Agony Aunts,
                                  who provide general advice through newspapers and magazines to readers who send in questions
                                  or requests. The 19th-century Agony Columns covered by our exhibition, while also interactive columns,
                                  can be distinguished from Agony Aunts due to their lack of focus on providing advice. However, the
                                  contents of both domains would often overlap, as many posted and complained about their love lives
                                  (or lack thereof), occasionally promoting themselves as potential wives or husbands to others. However,
                                  during the second half of the 19th century, more specialized women-oriented magazines and newspapers
                                  were established in response to the demand for practical advice and marriage opportunities.
                                  Though Agony Aunts bear some relation to their similarly named Agony Columns, specialized
                                  newspapers such as the <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i> and the <i>Matrimonial News</i>,
                                  may be seen as more direct precursors of contemporary Agony Aunt columns.  </p>
