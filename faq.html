                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">What are <i>The Times</i>?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">The Times was the most popular newspaper in Victorian England
                                  but also the <i>times</i> our exhibition explores. The years between 1860 and 1910 are often
                                  considered the “golden age” of newspapers in England, but most publications were eclipsed
                                  by the popularity of The Times, whose circulation rose from 5000 in 1815 to a staggering
                                  58,000 by 1855 (Winkworth 61). Today, it is possible to analyze these newspapers using
                                  computational tools thanks to databases making digitized versions of these papers accessible.</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">What were the “Agony Columns”?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">For much of the 19th century, Victorian newspapers featured a column on the
                                  first page known as the "Personal Advertisements," or simply "the personals." These were
                                  contributions written by individuals rather than journalists or editors, and often included
                                  complaint ads of all kinds, from lost loves to missing pets. The agonizing voice of the
                                  contributors was what eventually gave these personal columns the name of "the agonies" or
                                  "the agony columns."</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Why were some written cryptically?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">There are many answers to this question, and our exhibition
                                  attempts to provide some answers to shed light on the phenomenon. As newspapers grew in
                                  popularity, other cultural changes were also affecting Victorian society. Urbanization and
                                  industrialization contributed to a rising sense of anonymity in large cities, such as
                                  London, leading to what Benedict Anderson has called a "community in anonymity" (qtd. In
                                  Rubery 55). As a result, more people relied on the growing popularity of mass media,
                                  specifically the Agony Columns, as a form of communication, often with people they had no
                                  prior relationship. Such communication, however, was public, featured prominently on the
                                  front page of popular newspapers. In order to conduct private correspondences, contributors
                                  used codes and ciphers to avoid revealing their conversations to the Victorian public.</p>
                                <h4 class="my-sm-3 text-secondary">Who wrote coded messages in the Agony Columns?</h4>
                                <p class="mb-5 text-secondary">It is impossible to document precisely all the contributors and
                                  readers of 19th century agony columns. Our exhibition, however, focuses on three primary
                                  groups: tales of crime, stories of love, and narratives for fun. Criminals occasionally used
                                  the agony columns to communicate and schedule rendezvous locations and times. Others used
                                  the personals to find and develop relationships, and The Times columns have documented more
                                  than one runaway wife or husband, only to find them eloped or with their lovers at a later
                                  date. For readers, however, the Agony Columns were a source of tremendous entertainment, and
                                  many would spend hours reading about the dramatic stories unfolding before their eyes. Some
                                  even attempted to decipher these messages with varying degrees of success. Although it is
                                  difficult to know for sure, the concurrent rise of the Sensation Novel alongside the
                                  popularity of the Agony Columns may have led contributors to use the agonies as an outlet
                                  for creative writing, blurring fact and fiction and providing entertainment for the
                                  Victorian public, not unlike the crossword of today.</p>
